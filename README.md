Approximation Vector Machines
===========================

This Python code implement Approximation Vector Machines (AVM), presented in the paper "Approximation Vector Machines for Large-scale Online Learning" submitted to Journal of Machine Learning Research 2016.

The code is tested on Windows-based operating system with Python 2.7. Please make sure that you have installed *python-numpy* and *sklearn* to run the example.

Run the demo using this command
-------------------------------------
	python run_avm.py
